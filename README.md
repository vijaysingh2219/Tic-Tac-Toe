# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game!

## Game Instructions

Follow these instructions to play:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell of the grid.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If the entire grid is filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.
5. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column (0, 1, or 2) where they want to place their mark.

## How to Play

1. Player 'X' goes first. Enter your move by specifying the row and column.
   Example: Player 'X', enter your move (row and column): 1 1

2. The game will display the updated grid.

3. Player 'O' takes the next turn, and the process repeats until the game is won or tied.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions for each turn.

5. Enjoy the game and have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe!

Good luck!
